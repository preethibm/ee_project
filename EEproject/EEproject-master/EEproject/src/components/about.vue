            <p>A <span>TRip JaO</span> is a private retailer or public service that provides travel and tourism-related services to 
            the general public on behalf of accommodation or travel suppliers to offer different kinds of travelling packages for each destination. Travel agencies can provide outdoor recreation activities, airlines, car rentals, cruise lines, hotels, railways, travel insurance, package tours, insurance, guide books, VIP airport lounge access, arranging logistics for luggage and medical items delivery for travellers upon request, public transport timetables, car rentals, and bureau de change services. Travel agencies can also serve as general sales agents for airlines that do not have offices in a specific region. A travel agency's main function is to act as an agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. They do not keep inventory in-hand
            unless they have pre-booked hotel rooms or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or other group event.</p>
            <p>The demand for travel agents relies on a number of factors: economic growth, business and leisure travel, consumer income, airline seat availability, technological developments, and the price of jet fuel. The primary costs this industry has to cope with include computer services and telecommunication services. As many consumers are more often turning to online booking services, computer access is imperative, and will online services will increase overall profitability.

            Independent travel agencies depend on their marketing strategies to effectively appeal to the consumer and thus general a profit. Smaller companies put emphasis on catering to a small amount of large clientele, and serving a specific locale. Large travel agencies focus on corporate clients, and are able to provide a broad spectrum of services, as well as operate elaborate websites to promote their services.</p>
            <h3><u>Essentials We Provide</u></h3>
            <p>The three essential management reports are financial, operational and BI. Strictly speaking the only one that’s essential is the financial report. Why? Because it’s the basis of the company’s annual tax return and I don’t know of any government who views its tax revenue as something optional. But the other two aren’t essential only in the sense it also isn’t absolutely essential to run your business during the day rather than night. You’re free to operate only at night, but it gives the competition an overwhelming advantage. It’s the same with operational and BI reports: not having them isn’t against any law, but it will put your company at a huge disadvantage.

              Question: can you stop reading, close your eyes and articulate what each of the three reports does and why they’re uniquely valuable? Let’s take a look.

              Financial Reporting: often referred to as “Financial Statements”, this report contains a company’s cash flow statement, income statement, balance sheet and shareholder’s equity. Shareholder’s equity is out of scope because it relates to liquidated value and of little relevance to this discussion.<br><br>

              Cash Flow Statement: this is #1 because bills and debt are only settled with cash – not profits. Ever had a bank balance shock after a good sales week? That’s because sales cycles and cash cycles are very different. This statement shows the sources and amounts of cash coming into the company, and the uses and amounts of cash leaving the company: hopefully the former is always greater than the latter.  This is your company’s blood pressure – it’s vital this statement is detailed and easy to read.
              Within the past two years the terms “Big Data” and “Analytics” have been in the spotlight – and for good reason. These products can turn BI reporting into a much more effective tool for any travel company. For our purposes, “Big Data” is information purchased from a 3rd party (e.g. Google) in a structure compatible with a travel company’s data repository. “Analytics” are software tools that also integrate with the ERP system and extract information aggregated from all sources. For example, Gmail parsing (3rd party data) could reveal a number of repeat travel customers (CRM data) are also taking two and three day tours within driving distance of their homes – none of which is in sales (CRM data) history. Now travel agents have a new perspective on how to craft new travel values for them.

              Excluding the added functionality of Big Data and Analytics (which could be beyond many budgets), BI reporting should provide the following value:

              Metrics & Measurement: leveraging data from many sources, BI reports should enable management to define key performance metrics, then measure and report them on a daily and weekly basis. Well-defined metrics should foreshadow operating results, giving clarity to why outcomes have occurred. They will also allow employees and management to stay on the same page in terms of high priority actions and what performance levels are necessary.
              Intuitive Transparency: BI reporting should take aggregated data from several sources and use graphics to illustrate trends and exceptions in a way so that meaning is easily grasped.
              Management Dashboards: BI report features should include an easily customizable management dashboard that provides “at a glance” functionality for a comprehensive view of company performance.  
              Some readers may have mentally checked off all three reporting types as they read through this blog. That’s great – just be sure your making the right level of demands on what’s being delivered to you each day, week and month.

              It’s likely everyone was fine with financial reporting, and misses beyond the financials likely split disproportionally into the BI category. Missing either one will significantly affect competitiveness; missing both points to a serious weakness. However, the cure for both is the same: standardize data; aggregate information; extract with a robust reporting tool. A highly beneficial way to approach the cure is with a travel ERP system – it will not only accomplish all three activities, the system will also reduce costs by automating processes. </p>
